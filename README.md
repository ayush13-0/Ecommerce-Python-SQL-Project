# 📦 E-Commerce Database Analysis Using SQL & Python
This project performs data analysis on an E-commerce database using MySQL, Python, and Pandas.
A Jupyter Notebook (Ecommerce Python+SQL Project) is used to execute SQL queries directly from Python and analyze the results.

🎯 Project Objectives
- Connect Python to a MySQL E-commerce database
- Run SQL queries from Jupyter Notebook
- Analyze customers, orders, sales, and product category performance
- Visualize insights using Matplotlib & Seaborn

🧰 Tech Stack: 
Languages:
- Python
- SQL
Libraries Used:
- mysql-connector-python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

Database:
MySQL (Localhost)

🗄️ Database Tables Used
From the notebook, the database contains
- customers
- orders
- products
- order_items
- order_payments
- sellers
- geolocation

# 🔧 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Connect Python to MySQL
The notebook uses:

db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='root',
    password='your_password',
    database='Ecommerce'
)
cur = db.cursor()
- Enables running SQL queries directly from Python.

2️⃣ Execute SQL Queries
- The notebook contains multiple business-focused SQL queries including:

✔ 1. List all unique customer cities
- SELECT DISTINCT customer_city FROM customers;

✔ 2. Count number of orders placed in 2017
- SELECT COUNT(order_id)
  FROM orders
  WHERE YEAR(order_purchase_timestamp) = 2017;

✔ 3. Total sales by product category
SELECT 
    UPPER(products.product_category) AS category,
    SUM(order_items.price) AS sales
FROM order_items
JOIN products
    ON order_items.product_id = products.product_id
GROUP BY category;

- Results are loaded into Pandas DataFrames for further analysis.

3️⃣ Data Visualization
Visualizations created using:
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- import seaborn as sns

Examples:
- Bar chart of sales by category
- Distribution plots of sales
- Geographic insights (cities, states)

📊 Sample Analysis Performed
✔ Customer locations
✔ Order volume trends
✔ Sales by product category
✔ Seller performance
✔ Payment type distribution
